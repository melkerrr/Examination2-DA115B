Group assignment in the course "Sustainable Development" at Kristianstad University.

This project is an object-oriented Python application of a dice game called 'Pig'. When playing the game versus the computer, the computer's "intelligence" has been divided into 2 separate difficulty levels. These difficulty levels are 'easy' and 'hard', where the easy difficulty level is pretty much a guaranteed win for the player no matter how the player chooses to play. The hard difficulty level utilizes a well-known approach to the game which makes it harder for the player to win every time with this option selected.
